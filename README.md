EchoNet

EchoNet is a decentralized, peer-to-peer social network that runs entirely in the browser. No servers, no accounts, no data storage – everything happens directly between peers. Users can create public posts with hashtags, reply to posts, like posts, sort content by latest or popular, and create polls using bullet points. All content is synchronized in real-time between connected peers. A local content filter blocks illegal words, and rate limiting helps prevent spam. The network is fully decentralized and anonymous.

No registration is required. No databases or servers store any content, and there are no tracking tools or ads. Each user is responsible for their own posts.

To use EchoNet, open the website, choose a username, copy your Peer ID, exchange it with friends, and connect. You can then post, reply, like, and create polls.

EchoNet is open-source. You may view, modify, improve, and redistribute the code. Please keep the copyright notice and MIT License intact.

EchoNet is provided under the MIT License. Operators do not store or moderate content, and each user is responsible for their own posts.
